- ✅ Added note about **trendline with R²** displayed
- ✅ Included **sample size** (n = 4,352 models)

- ✅ Enhanced **alt text** for accessibility
- ✅ Section ID anchor: `#chart1`

### Chart 2: Technology vs Power

- ✅ Enhanced **alt text** describing distribution patterns
- ✅ Section ID anchor: `#chart2`

### Chart 3: Star Rating vs Power
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Referenced **trendline equation** format: "Power ≈ a − b×Stars"

### Chart 4: Brand Efficiency
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added **filtering note**: "brands with n ≥ 10 models" for statistical reliability
- ✅ **Sample sizes (n)** mentioned as shown next to bars
- ✅ Added **caveat** about normalization: "For fairer comparison, W/cm² would account for brands selling larger screens; this uses raw Watts"

- ✅ Enhanced **alt text**
- ✅ Section ID anchor: `#chart4`

### Chart 5: Bubble Chart (Area vs Stars)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specified **units clearly**: "square centimeters (cm²)" for area

- ✅ Explained bubble size legend maps to Watts
- ✅ Highlighted OLED/LED models in efficient zone achieving 6–8 stars with <100W
- ✅ Enhanced **alt text** with multi-dimensional description

### Chart 6: Time Trends
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specified **yearly aggregation**: ExpDate → year
- ✅ Mentioned **median** values plotted (not mean)
- ✅ Added **95% confidence interval bands** description
- ✅ Noted **sample sizes (n) per year** displayed on x-axis
- ✅ Added note about **sparse data years** (<50 models) showing wider CI bands
- ✅ Mentioned **Loess smoothing** may be applied
- ✅ Enhanced **alt text** with trend description
- ✅ Section ID anchor: `#chart6`
